# 🚀 Portfolio Clicker Game Rework Plan

## Current State (Pre-Rework)
- **Branch**: `feature/clicker-game-rework`
- **Status**: Ready for architectural refactor
- **Last Commit**: `9c0f241` - ML-themed clicker game implementation

## 🎯 Rework Objectives

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes
- [ ] Enable TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Add error boundaries and proper error handling
- [ ] Fix memory leaks in useClusteringGalaxy hook
- [ ] Add input validation for clicks and upgrades
- [ ] Handle localStorage errors gracefully

### Phase 2: Architecture Refactor
- [ ] Split monolithic useClusteringGalaxy hook into focused modules
- [ ] Create game engine class for better separation of concerns
- [ ] Centralize constants and configuration
- [ ] Add comprehensive TypeScript type definitions

### Phase 3: UX Improvements
- [ ] Add simple tutorial overlay
- [x] Improve HUD design and visibility — GalaxyUI now a dropdown with expandable right sidebar; sticky header shows key stats; larger mobile-friendly buttons
- [ ] Add progress indicators for upgrades
- [ ] Enhance visual feedback for user actions

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement frame rate limiting (60 FPS cap)
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics
- [ ] Optimize canvas rendering and draw calls
- [ ] Add performance settings for different devices

## 🐛 Critical Issues to Address

### 1. TypeScript Configuration
**File**: `tsconfig.json`
**Issue**: `"strict": false` defeats TypeScript purpose
**Priority**: HIGH

### 2. Memory Leaks
**File**: `hooks/useClusteringGalaxy.ts:313-333`
**Issue**: Event listeners and RAF not properly cleaned up
**Priority**: HIGH

### 3. Monolithic Architecture
**File**: `hooks/useClusteringGalaxy.ts` (1000+ lines)
**Issue**: Violates single responsibility principle
**Priority**: MEDIUM

### 4. Missing Error Handling
**File**: `components/ClusteringGalaxyCanvas.tsx`
**Issue**: No error boundaries for canvas failures
**Priority**: HIGH

### 5. Poor UX
**File**: `components/GalaxyUI.tsx:36-44`
**Issue**: HUD collapsed by default, no tutorial
**Priority**: MEDIUM

## 🎮 Tutorial Implementation Plan

### Simple Tutorial Design
- **Trigger**: Single glowing data point with "Click here" text
- **Action**: Click opens HUD panel and starts normal game flow
- **Message**: "Click glowing data points to feed cores. Level cores to earn IQ points."
- **Persistence**: One-time only, dismissed after first interaction

### Implementation Steps
1. Create `components/TutorialOverlay.tsx`
2. Add tutorial state to main page component
3. Integrate with existing game initialization
4. Style to match portfolio theme

## 📊 Performance Targets

- **Frame Rate**: Stable 60 FPS on modern devices
- **Memory Usage**: No leaks over 10+ minute sessions
- **Load Time**: Game initializes within 100ms
- **Canvas Performance**: Smooth animations without stuttering

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Checkout the rework branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/clicker-game-rework
   ```

2. **Start with Phase 1** - Fix critical bugs first
3. **Test thoroughly** - Each phase should be fully functional
4. **Maintain portfolio focus** - Game should enhance, not distract
5. **Document changes** - Update this file and code comments

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [x] Single core game initialization (completed - game starts with 1 core at top middle)
- [x] Tiny glowing data piece tutorial (completed - replaced giant button with subtle data piece)
- [x] Improved sidebar formatting (completed - optimized text sizes, spacing, and layout)
- [x] Performance optimizations (completed - added FPS monitoring, reduced motion auto-adjustment, canvas optimizations)
- [ ] All TypeScript errors resolved with strict mode enabled
- [ ] No memory leaks detected in 10+ minute sessions
- [ ] Tutorial successfully introduces new users to the game
- [ ] Performance remains stable at 60 FPS
- [ ] Code is maintainable with clear module separation
- [ ] Portfolio content remains the primary focus

## 📝 Recent Changes (Completed)

### Game Flow Improvements
- ✅ **Single Core Start**: Game now initializes with only 1 core positioned at top middle of screen (not covered by HUD)
- ✅ **Subtle Tutorial**: Replaced giant "Click Me" button with tiny glowing data piece next to core
- ✅ **Better UX**: Added animated arrow and "Click Me" text pointing to the data piece
- ✅ **Auto HUD**: HUD opens automatically when game starts with intro popup

### UI/UX Enhancements
- ✅ **GalaxyUI Revamp**: New top-right dropdown trigger; expandable right sidebar; sticky header with Tokens, IQ, Cores L1–L5 and Total; Total Collected and Currently Processing; upgrades moved under header; larger mobile-friendly buttons; Galaxy toggle removed from HUD
- ✅ **Compact Sidebar**: Optimized text sizes (10px-12px), reduced padding/margins, better spacing
- ✅ **Bulk Upgrade UI**: Streamlined quantity selectors and purchase buttons
- ✅ **IQ Upgrade Layout**: More compact display with abbreviated labels
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Better text fitting and reduced wasted space

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ **FPS Monitoring**: Real-time FPS tracking with automatic reduced motion when FPS < 30
- ✅ **Canvas Optimization**: Added image smoothing and composite operation settings
- ✅ **Memory Management**: Improved cleanup and reduced unnecessary operations
- ✅ **Auto-Adjustment**: Smart performance scaling based on system capabilities

## 📝 Notes

- The clicker game should remain a subtle background element
- Focus on maintaining the portfolio's primary purpose
- Ensure smooth performance across all devices
- Keep the ML theme consistent with the overall design
- Document all architectural decisions for future maintenance
